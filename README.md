# Colors of Iris
 *This is a proof of concept created in the fall of 2022 for SDEV 148 - Intro to Game Development.*
 
 *Developed in GameMaker Studio 2*
 
 ## Story
 *The stages of grief through gameplay and color*
 >Iris lives confined by shades of gray.

 >Growing up, her mother would read her fairy tales brimming with color. 
 When Iris loses her mother, she is comforted by the vivid stories she left with her.

 >9 years later, on the day of her mother’s death, Iris finds a strange, glowing object on the ocean’s shoreline near her house. Curious, she reaches for it and, on contact, is transported to a place she has always longed for.

 >Colors of Iris is a story of loss, introspection, and new beginnings. Follow Iris as she meets new    friends and explores a vast world of colorful adventures while grappling with her grief. 

 >In this 2D pixelart RPG, you’ll experience the wonder of seeing a rainbow for the first time.

## Iris
*Experience color through Iris' eyes*
